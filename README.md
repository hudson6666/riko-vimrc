# Riko-Vimrc

This is a light configuration with mainly the following features:

+ Support for mouse and clipboard
+ Show line numbers
+ Replace tab with 4 spaces
+ Pair brackets, Grammar highlights, Auto indent
+ Jump to where you were reading last time
+ Add author identity creating a new file
+ Pretty status bar and highlight current line

I do not use vim as an IDE but only an editor. So there were no complicated plugins and it starts up very quick.

## Install Guide

+ mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
+ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
+ cp .vimrc ~/.vimrc
+ Open a new vim editor and enter :PluginInstall (Network connection is required)
